Once upon a time, I realised that I haven't seen my best friend in six months even once. Time passed and we didn't even notice it — both of us had a lot of important things to do and messengers helped us to feel in touch.

I believe that friendship dries out without regular recharge. The realization of long separation made me feel sad.

To be aware of how long I haven't met my friends, I've made [«Friends»](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trulden.friends).

# Features

## Friendship journal

Friendship is held by memories and human memory is not reliable. «Friends» offers a helping hand.

Users write about stuff they did with friends and app stores those reliably.

## Last interactions

App knows when you've met your friends for the last time and even counts days.

Interaction types are in full control of the user — if you don't like «Meetings» and «Texting», replace them with «Branches» or «Chillin'» or whatever.

## Trackers

When the time has come, tracker cards rise up in the list and turn from bleakish to neat.

One click and tracker expands, giving you a chance to refresh memories.

Trackers of friends-no-more can be hidden.

## Friend's page

Almost like a personal dossier.

Shows last interactions with a person and everything you've decided to write about them.

For example:
- How, when and where you've met for the first time
- Why do you cherish that person
- Person's [love language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages)

# Users

«Friends» already helping:
- Diary lovers
- People with bad memory and a big heart
- Polyamorous

## Helping people

I want to believe, «Friends» might help not only diary-lovers but also people with special needs.

Things popping into mind:
- Mentors or sponsors in [AA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous)-like groups.
- Checking on people with suicidal tendencies.
- People with Alzheimer's lose memories faster than me for sure.

I want to help people make their relationships stronger and add clarity to them.

Right now, I have no idea, how to get «Friends» to those people. I'd be happy to hear any advice.

If you think that «Friends» can make somebody's life better — give a sign.
